#Integrations

Integrating third party components with LOGman is super easy.

By integrating LOGman with another component, activities from the latest will get logged and made available in a variety of forms: HTML/JSON Activity Streams, CSV exports, etc.

There are two ways of integrating LOGman with your components. The prefered way will depend on the framework the extension was built with. If the component was built using the Joomla! Framework, the [guide](joomla.md) for integrating Joomla! components is the one you are looking for. On the other hand, if the component was build using the [Nooku Framework](http://www.nooku.org/), please refer to the [guide](nooku.md) for integrating Nooku components with LOGman.
