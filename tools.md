We developed a set of free and open source Joomla development tools. In fact, they aren't just for extension developers, but are ideal for template work, and general Joomla site building.

* [Composer](/tools/composer.html) - Extension installer for Joomla
* [Console](/tools/console.html) - Command line interface for Joomla
* [Vagrant](/tools/vagrant.html) - Preconfigured Vagrant box for Joomla
