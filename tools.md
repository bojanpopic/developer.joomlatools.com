We actually produce a great set of **Joomla** development **tools** which you are absolutely free to use. In fact, they aren't just for extension developers, but are ideal for template work, and general Joomla site building.  

In this section of the docs we show you how to use the Joomla console and the Joomlatools Vagrant Box to drastically increase the productivity of you and your development team, while providing each member with the exact same work environment. We also get into Composer and discuss how to use it in your development to distribute your work.
