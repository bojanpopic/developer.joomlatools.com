## Contributing Guide

The entire contents of our developer portal is available on [Github](https://github.com/joomlatools/developer.joomlatools.com), as well as the [custom tools](https://github.com/joomlatools/) we created.

If you want to contribute to the developer portal, feel free to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) one of [our projects](https://github.com/joomlatools/), create a feature branch, and send us a pull request!

Assuming you already have [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) installed:

    npm install
    gitbook serve

The site is now available at ```http://localhost:4000``.
