# How Can Vagrant Help You?

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) is a tool for managing virtual machines from providers such as VMWare and Virtualbox.

It lets you create, setup and destroy virtual machines with a single command. It comes with a base operating system and builds called boxes and server provisioning software to make it easy to install and configure the virtual machine to your needs.

Using Vagrant with Virtualbox, you can set up a Joomla development environment from scratch in minutes.
