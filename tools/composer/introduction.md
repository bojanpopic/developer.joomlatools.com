# Composer

## Introduction

Are you a developer and tired of re-installing the same extensions over and over again or every time you start a new Joomla project? Wouldn’t it be great if you could install and update multiple Joomla extensions in one go, without lifting a finger?

What if you create websites for clients on a regular basis and you require tools that allow you to get things done quickly and automatically. That is why we have created a Composer installer for Joomla extensions.

## Composer to the rescue

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP. You can instruct Composer to pull in all the required extensions you need in your site using a single JSON file. This will keep all your dependencies in one convenient location and Composer will take care of upgrading and managing them.

Composer has become the de-facto standard for managing dependencies in the PHP community today. Because of its ease of use and community-wide support, it’s simply the best tool to manage extensions for a Joomla setup.
