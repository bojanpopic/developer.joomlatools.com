## Advanced usage

The previous example is a very basic way to use our [Composer plugin](https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-composer). For a more elaborate usage description, please refer to the description on our [Github repository](https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-composer).

Using the installer you can now publish your extensions to [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) so everyone can install them or host them on a private repository and use [Satis](https://github.com/composer/satis) to make them available inside your company. Doing so will reduce the amount of code you need to configure Composer to a single line!

The installer allows you to ensure your developers and designers all work with exactly the same versions of certain extensions and keep everyoneâ€™s development environment in sync. You can distribute your extensions faster than before and never have to deal with installer uploads which are too big for PHP to handle.

To make your extension available to other users or to take advantage of all of Composer's features you should consider referring to the [Custom Package](#creating-a-custom-package) section.
