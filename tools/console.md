## Introduction

Testing Joomla extensions can be a tedious task. You need to setup different versions of Joomla, install your extensions, configure Joomla, run different testsâ€¦ Doing all this manually is very laborious and time consuming.

At [Joomlatools](http://www.joomlatools.com) we are testing almost daily and had to come up with a better way to quickly and automatically install Joomla sites. And so the joomla-console came to life as the main engine of our [joomla-vagrant](http://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-vagrant) box.

## How can this package help you?

[Joomla Console](https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-console) is a command line console for common Joomla operations like creating and deleting sites, installing extensions, symlinking files etc. so that you don't have to perform these tasks over and over again.

You can see [a little video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62qX5dtBQwY&vq=hd720&wide=1) showing how to use it to setup a Joomla site with just one command.
