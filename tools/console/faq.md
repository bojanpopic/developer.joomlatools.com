## What are the requirements to run this application?

A Unix based operating system such as MacOS or Linux. (Windows users can use our [Joomla vagrant box](https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-vagrant))

## I don't like messing around on my computer. Is there an easier installation method?

Definitely! We have created a pre-configured box to build Joomla sites. You just need to download it and you're ready to go.

For more information, take a look at our [Joomlatools Vagrant box](../vagrant/introduction.md)!

## Can I add custom functionality?

You most certainly can! We have created a plugin system that allows you to insert 3rd part and custom commands very easily. See the [Plugins](plugins.md) section for more information and examples.
