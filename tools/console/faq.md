## What are the requirements to run this application?

A Unix based operating system such as MacOS or Linux. (Windows users can use our [Joomla vagrant box](https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-vagrant))

## I don't like messing around on my computer. Is there an easier installation method?

Definitely! We have created a pre-configured box to build Joomla sites. You just need to download it and you're ready to go.
