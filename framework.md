All of Joomlatools Extensions are powered by the [Nooku Framework](http://www.nooku.org). 

Nooku is a modern PHP framework, which provides a number of amazing features to extension that use it. It provides an unparalleled combination of **flexibility, re-usability** and **extensibility**. 

We've provided some documentation here to help with some framework level concepts as they relate to our extensions. To get deeper into what's possible, you can always head over to the [Nooku Framework Guides](http://guides.nooku.org/) and develop your own awesome extensions.
