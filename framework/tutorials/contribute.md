## Contribute to the Guides

We encourage our community to contribute to the Guides (in fact we encourage you to contribute to the Framework as well).

_Maybe you've figured out something that you would like to share?_ ... [Write a Tutorial](contribute/write-a-tutorial.md)!

_See something that's not quite complete or even in the sections of the Guides?_...Feel free to write or rewrite it for the rest of the community.

Simply fork this Joomlatools Framework Guides repository, and when you are done with your (carefully reviewed) edits make a Pull Request so we can review.
